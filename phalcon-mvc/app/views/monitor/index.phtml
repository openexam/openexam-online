<h1>System Monitoring</h1>

<p>Click on one of the buttons below to start.</p>

<ul><li>The performance page displays various counters useful for diagnostic bottlenecks in the system (like CPU, memory or network utilization).</li>
    <li>The diagnostics page is used to monitor health of system services (for example authentication or directory services).</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<p><i class="fa fa-exclamation"></i> These tools are strictly for system monitoring and are probably of zero to none interest for ordinary users.</p>
<br/>
<div>
    <button id="performance" class="btn btn-primary">Performance</button>
    <button id="diagnostics" class="btn btn-primary">Diagnostics</button>
