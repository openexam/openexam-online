/**
 * Location definitions.
 * 
 * These entries defines locations for access control definition (available
 * in exam security view) and for location aware user information. The array
 * is grouped by organization, campus and place (e.g. UU -> BMC -> B1:3).
 * 
 * Each place can contain 'desc', 'info' and 'addr' keys:
 * 
 * o) The desc key contains a short information text suitable for tooltip.
 * 
 * o) The info key is an URI with information about this place (e.g. computer 
 *    specific information). The URI is either a complete URL or relative to
 *    this applications document root.
 * 
 * o) The addr key is an string or array with hostname, subnet, address range 
 *    or IP address for this place. Multiple addresses can also be separated
 *    by a semi-colon (';') or placed in an array.
 * 
 * The entries should be ordered from most specific to more general. A "catch
 * all" entry might appear last in the list:
 * 
 * '*' => array(
 *      '*' => array(
 *              'World' => array(
 *                      'addr' => '0.0.0.0/0'
 *              )
 *      )
