/**
 * Represents the exam state.
 * 
 * State:
 * ---------
 * 
 * <code>
 * $state = new State($exam);
 * if($state->has(State::DECODABLE)) {
 *      // decode examination...
 * }
 * if($state->getState() & State::DECODABLE) {
 *      // decode examination...
 * }
 * </code>
 * 
 * Two special cases arise based on starttime/endtime:
 * 
 * o) starttime == null -> The exam is considered to be a draft (not yet scheduled).
 * o) endtime   == null -> The exam is ongoing (running), but without an ending.
 * 
 * Cache:
 * ---------
 * 
 * The answered and corrected properties are quite expensive to compute and
 * are therefor cached for 30 seconds to overcome slow query problems when
 * many students tries to read an exam. 
 * 
 * During this period the exam state might be inconsistent, but the impact 
 * should be minimal and the benefit that large to justify this. If problem
 * with decoding arise, then the corrected cache can be invalidated when a
 * answer result is saved.
