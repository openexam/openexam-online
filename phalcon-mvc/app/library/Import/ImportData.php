/**
 * The import data.
 * 
 * All import classes should use this class to define the data to be inserted
 * in the database. For creating an instance of this class and load an
 * XML document, do either one of these:
 * <code>
 * // Load from file:
 * $data = simplexml_load_file($xmlfile, 'ImportData');
 * 
 * // Load from string:
 * $data = simplexml_load_string($xmldoc, 'ImportData');
 * 
 * // Pass string direct to base class constructor:
 * $data = new ImportData('&lt;root/&gt;');
 * </code>
 * 
 * This really shows how sucky OOP in PHP is. It's not possible to define the
 * map as property as it interfers with SimpleXMLElement.
